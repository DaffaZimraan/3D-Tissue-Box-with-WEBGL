## 📝 Description

A 3D animated tissue box visualization created using WebGL. The project demonstrates various computer graphics concepts including 3D geometry creation, texture mapping, lighting effects, and animation.

This project implements a 3D tissue box model with:
- Animated rotation on X and Y axes
- Realistic lighting and shading effects
- Wood texture mapping on the box lid
- Semi-transparent outer box walls
- Dynamic tissue simulation with wave-like movement
- Phong lighting model implementation
